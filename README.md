# webapp-docker-k8s

In this assignment, we will deploy a web application on Kubernetes using Docker
containers. We will start by containerizing the application using Docker, create
a persistence volume, and push the image to Docker Hub. Then, deploy the
container on a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube and then deploy it on AWS
EKS. We will also explore various Kubernetes features such as a replication
controller, health monitoring, rolling updates, and alerting.
